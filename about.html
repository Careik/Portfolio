  <!-- About Me Story -->
  <section class="about-section">
    <h4 class="font-black title-padding">The Beginning</h4>
    <p class="font-black paragraph-padding">
      As a kid, I loved creating custom backgrounds on my desktop. I would spend hours cutting photos from
      Google Images and copying them into Microsoft Paint, adding shapes, changing colors, and editing them
      to match my vision. I always enjoyed this creative outlet but never considered it as a career option.
    </p>
    <p class="font-black paragraph-padding">
      <br>On the other hand, I love science. I studied Biology in college and was hired to work for a pharmaceutical
      company shortly after graduation. I was working on medications that literally saved people's lives. It felt
      as if I had landed my dream job. However, there is no creative outlet in the drug manufacturing process. The
      pharmaceutical industry is extremely regulated, which leaves little room for the implementation of creative
      improvements into the process. I had the opportunity to design a pH table using AutoCAD. This table was made
      with the user in mind and improved the day to day operations of our technicians.
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-black title-padding">That Fateful Night</h4>
    <p class="font-black paragraph-padding">
      Everything changed for me one night in 2017. At the time, I lived in an apartment with one of my long time friends,
      who happens to be a web developer. We enjoyed brainstorming quirky business ventures that we would never actually
      pursue. One idea was to take old, worn-out purses and upcycle them. We called it “From Hearse to Purse.”
    </p>
    <p class="font-black paragraph-padding">
      <br>On one fateful night, we thought of an app concept that we believed to be our best idea yet. We called the app
      Points - Your Actions Matter. Essentially a long forum scoreboard, the app would allow users to award and deduct
      points away from their friends. The prospect of actualizing our idea into reality enveloped our lives. We
      purchased a computer and decided to develop the app. My roommate developed the back-end code, while I worked tirelessly
      on designing front-end mockups. With no formal training or experience, I designed the entire UI of the application. I
      worked on branding, including logo design, color palettes, and typography. After two years of nights and weekends, a lot
      of trial and error, and phone calls with Apple, our app was approved and made available on the Apple app store.
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-black title-padding">Here We Are Today</h4>
    <p class="font-black paragraph-padding">
      The experience of designing an app sparked my passion for user-center and process-driven design. I am genuinely interested
      in UX because it is the merging of both of my passions, science and creativity. I get to use the research skills I learned
      in pharmaceuticals and combine them with my zest for creativity to design solutions to problems. I get to turn a thought
      into a tangible product with no bounds or restrictions.
    </p>

    <p class="font-black paragraph-padding">
      <br>When I began my journey into UX design, I would create designs based on how I thought they should be. I was not cognisant of
      how the experience would be for the users. I have since learned that design is much more than looks. It is about solving
      problems for the user through an iterative process that requires empathy. User experience design is like an endless
      game of brainstorming to create the best possible solution and that is why I find it so enjoyable.
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-black title-padding">What Sets Me Apart</h4>
    <p class="font-black paragraph-padding">
      The last thing I will say is that I think I can bring something to table that most people cannot. What that is, is a deep understanding of the importance of accessibility.
      My wife works as a disability rights advocate in the state of New York where she is constantly advocating for disability rights. One of those rights
      is an accessible internet. Because of her, I am able to understand why it is so important to have an accessible internet and just how <span class="bold">inaccessible</span>
      our current internet is. She is constantly fighting for the basic needs of people with disabilities and I want to help her on her crusade to make the internet more accessible.
      I promise to make it an absolute priority of mine to make sure that every design I create is accessible to all. Having this knowledge is not only important, but it makes
      me a better designer.
    </p>

    I hope you liked what I had to say, and I hope you decide to work with me. Please send me an email or message me via the contact page and I will respond to you as soon as possible. Cheers!
